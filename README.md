How to install: 
1. Inside Google Chrome inspect element, create a new javascript snippet named "dailyauto". 

2. Inside the snippet, paste the following code: 

```
let acceptButtons = document.getElementsByClassName("components-home-assets-__sign-content_---sign-award---1YRH31")

for (let button of acceptButtons){
    button.click()
}
```

3. Once complete, run the batch file. 

Note: This automation tool is still WIP. It was designed so that I could be lazy.
